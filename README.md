## My process

1. Coming up with accessible & semantic HTML structure that provides hooks for styling.
2. Development of mobile macro layout.
3. Micro layout for the small details like pricing, body text line heights etc.
4. Development of desktop macro layout.
5. Adjusting details & spacing as necessary

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Coming up with proper HTML structure pays off and saves some development time later. Looking at both mobile **and** desktop design is crucial for determining the best structure for responsive styling.
